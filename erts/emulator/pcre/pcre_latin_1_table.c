/* This file was automatically written by the make_latin1_table auxiliary
program. It contains character tables that are used when no external
tables are passed to PCRE by the application that calls it. The tables
are used only for characters whose code values are less than 256.

The following #includes are present because without them gcc 4.x may remove
the array definition from the final binary if PCRE is built into a static
library and dead code stripping is activated. This leads to link errors.
Pulling in the header ensures that the array gets flagged as "someone
outside this compilation unit might reference this" and so it will always
be supplied to the linker. */
